Web design

Index page of the website for a non-profit organisation. 

Phase 1
The index page of the website. This front page has a svg map of Africa and once a guest clicks on a country on the map, the details and photo of the representative in that country is shown. A button is below the photo for a modal contact form or a slide out contact form.

The data on the page must dynamically update from the database on every mouse_click ie. use jquery AJAX Get command and json to get data from a mysql database.

The Regional representatives can also log in from this page via a slide down login. 

Things to do : Phase 1
  1. Get the AJAX to work and post country clicked to the database.
  2. Get data to display in the DOM once it is fetched from the database.
  3. Get the modal or slideout contact form to work.
  4. Modify the slide down login to change to an user admin section after login.
